TIP Fusion-Evaporation DSAM GEANT4 Code
Maintainer: Jonathan Williams

Tested with GEANT4.9.4 on Scientific Linux 6, Ubuntu 14.04, and Ubuntu 15.10.

Reimplemented GEANT4 classes:
G4IonParametrisedLossModel (GEANT4.9.4) - reimplemented as G4IonCustomModel to allow for user defined stopping powers
G4IonStoppingData (GEANT4.9.4) - reimplemented as G4IonCustomStoppingData to allow for user defined stopping powers
G4NuclearDecayChannel (GEANT4.9.4) - minimally modified to allow gamma cascades
