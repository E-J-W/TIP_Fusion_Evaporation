TIP Fusion-Evaporation DSAM GEANT4 Code
Maintainer: Jonathan Williams

GEANT4 code implementing TIP/TIGRESS DSAM using a fusion-evaporation reaction process.  Depends on GEANT4, CLHEP, and ROOT (results are saved to ROOT tree files).  Requires proper setup of environment variables for each, for example by adding the follwing lines to ~/.bashrc (substituting the appropriate paths):

#ROOT configuration
export ROOTSYS=/path/to/root
export ROOTINC=/path/to/root/include
export ROOTLIB=/path/to/root/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$ROOTSYS/lib/
export PATH=$PATH:$ROOTSYS/bin

#CLHEP configuration
export CLHEPSYS=/path/to/clhep
export PATH=$PATH:$CLHEPSYS/bin:$CLHEPSYS/lib

#for GEANT4
#the next line should point to the env.sh file generated upon installation/configuration of GEANT4
source /path/to/env.sh
export G4INSTALL=/path/to/geant4_install_directory

Tested with GEANT4.9.4 on Scientific Linux 6, Ubuntu 14.04, and Ubuntu 15.10.


Reimplemented GEANT4 classes:
G4IonParametrisedLossModel (GEANT4.9.4) - reimplemented as G4IonCustomModel to allow for user defined stopping powers
G4IonStoppingData (GEANT4.9.4) - reimplemented as G4IonCustomStoppingData to allow for user defined stopping powers
G4NuclearDecayChannel (GEANT4.9.4) - minimally modified to allow gamma cascades
